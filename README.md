# pi-puzzler
steve's puzzle box set built in python and meant to create a little bootable puzzle set for a raspberry pi. There are some bashrc scripts that need to go along with this to ensure that it opens up on startup. but I'll prolly clean some of this info out to make sure that we don't give too much away to the participants

To start playing type in python3 puzzler-main.py

This is meant to run in python3, but hopping over to python2 is pretty easy- just gotta change the input() to raw_input(), at least until this becomes more complicated...
